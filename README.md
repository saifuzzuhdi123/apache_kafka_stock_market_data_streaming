## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize Apache Kafka to build a robust system for streaming stock market data in real-time. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for capturing and processing data efficiently. 

The entire implementation is done in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and modify. The project is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, and we leverage AWS services like S3, Athena, Glue, and Crawler for data consumption.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: For streaming and processing data.
- **AWS EC2**: For hosting the application.
- **AWS S3**: For storing data.
- **AWS Athena**: For querying data.
- **AWS Glue**: For data preparation and transformation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation.

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash

   cd apache_kafka_stock_market_data_streaming
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: 
   Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Necessary Files**: 
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/saifuzzuhdi123/apache_kafka_stock_market_data_streaming/releases) to download the files you need to execute.

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: 
   Start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the Notebook**: 
   Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your browser and follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can start using it by following the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. The main notebook, `data_streaming.ipynb`, provides a comprehensive guide on how to stream stock market data using Apache Kafka.

### Example Workflow

1. **Producing Data**: Use `kafka_producer.py` to send stock market data to the Kafka topic.
2. **Consuming Data**: Use `kafka_consumer.py` to read the data from the Kafka topic and process it.
3. **Data Storage**: Store the processed data in AWS S3 for further analysis.
4. **Data Analysis**: Use AWS Athena to run SQL queries on the stored data.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance. Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to deploy it:

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**: Create a new EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
2. **Install Dependencies**: SSH into your instance and install the necessary software, including Kafka and Python.
3. **Upload Project Files**: Use SCP or SFTP to transfer the project files to your EC2 instance.
4. **Run Kafka**: Start the Kafka server and create the necessary topics.
5. **Execute Notebooks**: Run the Jupyter Notebook on your EC2 instance to start streaming data.
